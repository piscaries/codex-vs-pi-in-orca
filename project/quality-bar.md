# Quality bar: Chess Coach

Every role applies this. Passing tests is not enough; a beginner must be able to use the coach and learn from it.

## Correct
1. **The rules are never wrong.** The app never allows an illegal move, never rejects a legal one, and always detects checkmate and stalemate.
2. **The coach never says something false.** A comment that says a piece is unprotected, or that a move loses material, must be true in the position. A wrong comment is worse than no comment.

## Useful
3. **Mistakes come with a reason and a fix.** When a move is a mistake or blunder, the coach names the concrete problem (which piece, which square, what the opponent can now do) and suggests a better move.
4. **Plain words.** Comments use language a beginner understands. No engine numbers or notation without an explanation. One or two sentences per move.
5. **Proportionate.** The coach does not nag. Good moves get a short acknowledgement, not a lecture.

## Playable
6. **Strength the user can choose.** At the lowest level a beginner can win; at the highest level a beginner should rarely win. Levels are clearly different.
7. **Responsive.** The computer replies within two seconds at every level, and the page never freezes while it thinks.
8. **Clear board.** The board shows the last move, check, and whose turn it is. Pieces are easy to tell apart.

## Honest
9. **The end-of-game review matches the game.** Every move it lists was actually played, and its comments agree with the comments shown during the game.
